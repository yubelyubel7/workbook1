        <h1>Hunt and Gather</h1>
        
        <p class="intro">For this week, our hunt and gather theme was to search for different ways websites visualise data.</p>
        
        <div class="visualizations">

                <h2>Music DNA Visualisation</h2>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe src="https://pudding.cool/2025/04/music-dna/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="description">pudding.cool is a cool website that visualises the way different music are related to one another. The DNA of music and how it is passed down from generations and onwards. By the end you get to see a massive family tree of how the different songs are connected.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="viz-item">
                <h2>Every Noise at Once</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="https://everynoise.com" target="_blank">
                        <img src="../../IMG/everynoiseatonce.jpg" alt="Every Noise at Once Screenshot">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p class="description">everynoise.com is another interesting website. It is quite similar to pudding.cool, but it takes a much more simpler approach. It simply just puts all the different music genres in your face as text and lets you scroll through the page clicking them one by one as they start playing exerpts from said genre.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="viz-item">
                <h2>1 Pixel Wealth</h2>
                <div class="iframe-container">
                    <iframe src="https://eattherichtextformat.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <p class="description">1 pixel wealth is another interesting visualisation of data. The site scrolls almost endlessly horizontally and really gives you the perspective of how much the wealth the richest people own in comparison to the everyday person.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="viz-item">
                <h2>Printing Money</h2>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <a href="https://neal.fun/printing-money/" target="_blank">
                        <img src="../../IMG/printingmoney.jpg" alt="Printing Money Screenshot">
                    </a>
                </div>
                <p class="description">The printing-money site from neal.fun is quite similar to the 1 Pixel Wealth website, it visualises the movement of money (income and spending) by animating the dollars moving from left to right. The more the spending/income, the faster it moves.</p>
