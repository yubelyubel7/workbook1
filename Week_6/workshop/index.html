        <p class="note">Note: There are likely more creative ways to re-create this visualisation of data. One of the inputs given during the workshop is to possibly arrange the items in a circular manner, as a way to show the playful nature of a cat. Alternatively, it could also be arranged in the opposite way as the most likely item is more further away, showing that it is trying to run away from the cat.</p>
