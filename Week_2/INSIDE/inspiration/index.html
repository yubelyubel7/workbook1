                <p>HackerTyper is an interesting old website I used to play around with as a kid. It allows the user to type anything on their keyboard and it automatically converts that into “hacker coding” along with the bright green CMD-like aesthetic.</p>

                <p>IsMyComputerOnFire.com is a comedic website that fits with my humour. I just really like the simplicity of it, it’s just a page that says No, because the likelihood that you would be able to access the website on a computer that happens to be on fire is likely nil.</p>

                <img src="../../../IMG/huntngather3.png" alt="pointerpointer">
                <p>pointerpointer.com is another old website I used to play with back in middle school. This website searches the web and its immense library of images for an image of someone pointing at the location of your cursor. I would definitely like to try to implement something like this to find a way to alternate the Streamer facecam gifs. somehow.</p>

                <p>rrrgggbbb.com is also a very simple website, but it does what it aims for. It’s just a coloured text of “RGB”, where when the user hovers over the different colours, the whole page itself changes to follow the selected colour.</p>
