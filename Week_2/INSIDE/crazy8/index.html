            <p>For our week 2 class activity, we were tasked to do some Crazy 8â€™s, which is to quickly create 8 ideation sketches for our workbook. Admittedly, I did not realise it was for the workbook, so my ideas were just for Interactive Websites in general LOL XD LMAO. Since we only have a minute for each idea, I had to quickly draw up ideas that I already had at the top of my head. </p>
            <p>The first idea was just thinking of some movement aspect to the website, like maybe a ball that can fall down and bounce around? Then the next idea was a more ambitious one, with a 3D space that can be spun around to look at a character. At this point, I was panicking thinking of ideas, so I defaulted to my comfort, which was making use of character illustrations, so the ideas coming up were heavily centred around that. An interactive desktop pet that can be picked up? A very very minimal designed screen with just 1 button that would lead to a linear exploration. A cartoon world with many little guys walking around, possibly each one can be clicked to lead to a different page. Another animated site with a box and a character inside it, the character may be different each refresh and then it will lead to a different page. A magical themed page where the wand follows the cursor. And finally, the cursor being a hand holding a gun that is pointed at a character, shooting the character would then lead to an animation and then the next page.

            <h2>Paper Mockup</h2>

            <p>Following the ideations, we were tasked to create a paper prototype of our favourite idea. At this point, I knew it was for the workbook, so I used the elements I liked most from all my ideas and settled for a desktop with a Twitch streamer interface. The main idea is that there is a character who is streaming the desktop screen, with a chat screen that has pre-generated messages from the viewers and an occasional donation that would show up. The character would be looping a gif and occasionally swap between different gifs to adjust to the situation. There would then be a file called Workbook.exe that can be opened to present a windows xp like window screen with the different weeks to be explored. </p>
