                    <p>In our 7th week, we moved into learning about Physical Computing(SCARY!). We were introduced to the Arduino starter kit and had to identify the different components. The cheat sheet above was the final result of our identification. From this we were able to slightly familiarise ourselves with the different part, making the module slightly less daunting.</p>
