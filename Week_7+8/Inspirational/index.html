                    <h2>Fish playing Pokemon</h2>
                    <p>One of my first inspirations for physical computing was the Fish playing Pokemon project. It was quite simple, a camera was set up to record the fish and depending on the fish' location, that would give different inputs for the pokemon game. Somehow, the fish managed to finish the entire game after given enough time. This just shows that with Physical Computing, we're really able to adapt anything to use tools/interfaces that they're not meant to use at all.</p>

                    <h2>The Useless Machine</h2>
                    <p>One of my favourite creations. I remember seeing this machine around the internet quite a bit. It really highlights the entire "why". Why do we make machines anyway? The Useless Machine essentially does nothing, it just resets to stage 1 everytime the user tries to use it by hitting the switch. I love that just a simple performance is able to give somewhat of a personality to the tiny box.</p>

                    <h2>https://joeyderuiter.me</h2>
                    <p>Back to some website inspirations. This website I found was another portfolio site that takes the retro OS aesthetic to another level. Fully implementing their folio into the Operating System style, while also adding some quirky fun interactivities such as a fully playable DOOM through js-dos</p>

                    <h2>Uniqlo RFID Tags</h2>
                    <p>Uniqlo's quick and easy price calculation is another example of great integration of physical computing into day to day life. The uniqlo tags uses RFID tags which are quickly scanned by RFID sensors within the checkout box, allowing us consumers to quickly see the total price and pay.</p>
